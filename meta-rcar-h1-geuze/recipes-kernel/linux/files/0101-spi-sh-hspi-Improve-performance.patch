Subject: [PATCH 101/215] spi: sh-hspi: Improve performance

The driver attempts to read the recieved data immediately after
writing to the transmit buffer. If no data is available, the driver
currently waits 20ms until trying again. Since the hardware needs
to shift out the transmitted data, the first poll always fails,
leading to 20ms delay between bytes.

This patch reduces the polling interval to 1us, and also reduces
the timeout to 10ms.
